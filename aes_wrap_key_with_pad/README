Here are the patches to add advanced AES key wrap *with pad*, aka RFC 5649,
to Botan (1.10, not 1.11 even it should be easy).
PS: standardized (and approved) under the KWP name in NIST SP 800-38F.

OpenSSL added support for RFC 5649 in commit
d31fed73e25391cd71a0de488d88724db78f6f8a and it is waiting for nearest release.
Some distributions backported the interface, e.g. Fedora and RHEL.
