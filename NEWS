Bugfixes:
* Coverity found a number of issues.


SoftHSM 2.0.0b1 - 2014-09-10

* SOFTHSM-84: Check that all mandatory attributes are given during
  the creation process.
* SOFTHSM-92: Enable -fvisibility=hidden on per default
* SUPPORT-137: Implement C_EncryptUpdate and C_EncryptFinal
  (Patch from Martin Paljak)
* Add support for CKM_RSA_PKCS key un/wrapping
  (Patch from Petr Spacek)

Bugfixes:
* SOFTHSM-66: Attribute handling when using multiple threads
* SOFTHSM-93: Invalid C++ object recycling.
* SOFTHSM-95: umask affecting the calling application.
* SOFTHSM-97: Check if Botan has already been initialized.
* SOFTHSM-98: Handle mandatory attributes for DSA, DH, and ECDSA
  correctly.
* SOFTHSM-99: Binary encoding of GOST values.
* SUPPORT-136: softhsm2-keyconv creates files with sensitive material
  in insecure way.


SoftHSM 2.0.0a2 - 2014-03-25

* SOFTHSM-68: Display a better configure message when there is a 
  version of Botan with a broken ECC/GOST/OID implementation.
* SOFTHSM-70: Improved handling of the database backend.
* SOFTHSM-71: Supporting Botan 1.11.
* SOFTHSM-76: Do not generate RSA keys smaller than 1024 bit when 
  using the Botan crypto backend.
* SOFTHSM-83: Support CKA_VALUE_BITS for CKK_DH private key object.
* SOFTHSM-85: Rename libsofthsm.so to libsofthsm2.so and prefix the
  command line utilties with softhsm2-.
* SOFTHSM-89: Use constants and not strings for signaling algorithms.
* SUPPORT-129: Possible to use an empty template in C_GenerateKey.
  The class and key type are inherited from the generation mechanism.
  Some mechanisms do however require a length attribute. [SOFTHSM-88]
* SUPPORT-131: Support RSA-PSS using SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384,
  or SHA512. [SOFTHSM-87]

Bugfixes:
* SOFTHSM-39: Fix 64 bit build on sparc sun4v.
* SOFTHSM-69: GOST did not work when you disabled ECC.
* SOFTHSM-78: Correct the attribute checks for a number of objects.
* SOFTHSM-80: Prevent segfault in OpenSSL GOST HMAC code.
* SOFTHSM-91: Fix a warning from static code analysis.
* Fixed a number of memory leaks.


SoftHSM 2.0.0a1 - 2014-02-10

This is the first alpha release of SoftHSMv2. It focuses on a higher 
level of security by encrypting sensitive information and using 
unswappable memory. There is also a more generalized crypto backend,
where you can use Botan or OpenSSL.
