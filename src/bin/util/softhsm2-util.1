.SH DESCRIPTION
.B softhsm2-util
is a support tool mainly for libsofthsm2. It can also
be used with other PKCS#11 libraries by using the option
.B \-\-module
.PP
Read the sections below to get more information on
the libsofthsm2 and PKCS#11.
Most applications assumes that the token they want
to use is already initialized.
It is then up to the user
to initialize the PKCS#11 token.
This is done by using the PKCS#11 interface,
but instead of writing your own
tool you can use the
.B softhsm2-util
tool.
.PP
Keys are usually created directly in the token,
but the user may want to use an existing key pair.
Keys can be imported to a token by using the PKCS#11 interface,
but this tool can also be used if the
user has the key pair in a PKCS#8 file.
If you need to convert keys from
BIND .private-key format over to PKCS#8,
one can
use
.BR softhsm2-keyconv .
.LP
The libary
.BR libsofthsm2 ,
known as SoftHSM, provides cryptographic functionality
by using the PKCS#11 API.
It was developed as a part of the OpenDNSSEC project,
thus designed to meet the requirements
of OpenDNSSEC,
but can also work together with other
software that want to use the functionality
of the PKCS#11 API.
.PP
SoftHSM is a software implementation of a generic cryptographic device with a PKCS#11 interface.
These devices are often called tokens.
Read in the manual softhsm2.conf(5) on how to create these
tokens and how they are added to a slot in SoftHSM.
.LP
The 
.B PKCS#11
API
can be used to handle and store cryptographic keys.
This interface
specifies how to communicate with cryptographic devices such as HSMs
(Hardware Security Modules) and smart cards.
The purpose of these devices
is, among others,
to generate cryptographic keys and sign information without
revealing private-key material to the outside world.
They are often designed
to perform well on these specific tasks
compared to ordinary processes in a normal computer.
.LP
.SH ACTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-help\fR, \fB\-h\fR
Show the help information.
.TP
.B \-\-import \fIpath\fR
Import a key pair from the given
.IR path .
The file must be in PKCS#8-format.
.br
Use with
.BR \-\-file-pin ,
.BR \-\-slot ,
.BR \-\-pin ,
.BR \-\-no\-public\-key ,
.BR \-\-label ,
and
.BR \-\-id .
.TP
.B \-\-init-token
Initialize the token at a given slot.
If the token is already initialized then this command
will reinitialize it, thus erasing all the objects in the token.
The matching Security Officer (SO) PIN must also
be provided when doing reinitialization.
.br
Use with
.BR \-\-slot ,
.BR \-\-label .
.BR \-\-so-pin ,
and
.BR \-\-pin .
.LP
.TP
.B \-\-show-slots
Display all the available slots and their current status.
.TP
.B \-\-version\fR, \fB\-v\fR
Show the version info.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-file-pin \fIPIN\fR
The
.I PIN
will be used to decrypt the PKCS#8 file.
If not given then the PKCS#8 file is assumed to be unencrypted.
.TP
.B \-\-force 
Use this option to override the warnings and force the given action.
.TP
.B \-\-id \fIhex\fR
Choose an ID of the key pair.
The ID is in hexadecimal with a variable length.
Use with
.B \-\-force 
when importing a key pair if the ID already exists.
.TP
.B \-\-label \fItext\fR
Defines the
.I label
of the object or the token.
.TP
.B \-\-module \fIpath\fR
Use another PKCS#11 library than SoftHSM.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-public\-key
Do not import the public key.
.TP
.B \-\-pin \fIPIN\fR
The
.I PIN
for the normal user.
.TP
.B \-\-slot \fInumber\fR
The slot where the token is located.
.TP
.B \-\-so-pin \fIPIN\fR
The
.I PIN
for the Security Officer (SO).
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
The token can be initialized using this command:
.LP
.RS
.nf
softhsm2-util \-\-init-token \-\-slot 1 \-\-label "A token"
.fi
.RE
.LP
A key pair can be imported using the softhsm tool where you specify the path
to the key file, slot number, label and ID of the new objects, and the
user PIN.
The file must be in PKCS#8 format.
.LP
.RS
.nf
softhsm2-util \-\-import key1.pem \-\-slot 1 \-\-label "My key" \\
.ti +0.7i
\-\-id A1B2 \-\-pin 123456
.fi
(Add, \-\-file-pin
.IR PIN ,
if the key file is encrypted.)
