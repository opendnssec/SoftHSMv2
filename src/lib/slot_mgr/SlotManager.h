 SlotManager.h

 The slot manager is a class that forms part of the PKCS #11 core. It manages
 all the slots that SoftHSM is aware of. To make it possible to add new
 tokens, SoftHSM always has one slot available that contains an uninitialised
 token. Users can choose to initialise this token to create a new token.
